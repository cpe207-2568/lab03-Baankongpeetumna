              In 2021, I participated in <span class="fontbig">the FTC competition</span> as the CEO &
              Strategy of our team, where I was responsible for planning,
              managing the project direction, and defining strategies to enhance
              our robot's performance. Our team successfully advanced to the
              national round and received the Popular Vote award . This award
              reflected the strength, which met competition standards. The experience also
              improved my leadership.</span
